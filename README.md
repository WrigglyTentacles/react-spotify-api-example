# react-spotify-api-example
This is an updated version of the react spotify api example that web dev simplified did about a year ago. He used a bunch of packages for handling the post/get requests and i wanted to do those myself so i used axios, I also decided I didn't want the lyrics bit in there so i've left it out. Hope it Helps!
